### About

I wrote this using a weather api. It is a simple site I configured so that in the morning I can check exactly what weather to except for the next 6 hours so I can plan my daughters outfit out.  I needed to know how cold it was now.. does she need a sweater?  how cold or hot will it be during the time at school and what will the weather be at pick up time for her?

    It displays: 
    | the weather now | the weather in 3 hours time | the weather in 6 hours at school pick up|
    | --------------- | :-------------------------: | --------------------------------------: |
    | What the kid    | What kind of temperatures   | When it is time to pick up the kid      |
    | should wear     | will there be at snack      | will be raining should I bring an       |
    | going to school | and later lunch time        | umbrella?                               |

Simple solution using HTML CSS and JavaScript
